# Real-Estate-VR-Application-using-Unity

This repository contains the implementation of a **Virtual Reality (VR) Real Estate Application** developed as part of a **Virtual Reality course project**.  
The project addresses the *visualization gap* in traditional real estate marketing by enabling **fully immersive, interactive VR property walkthroughs**.

---

## Project Overview

Traditional real estate listings rely on 2D photos and floor plans, which fail to convey:
- True scale and depth  
- Spatial layout  
- Lighting and ambiance  

This VR application allows users to:
- Walk through a property in full 3D VR
- Interact with objects using physics-based controls
- Control lighting dynamically for realistic inspection  

The project demonstrates how **legacy 3D assets** can be modernized using **Unity + OpenXR + URP + VR Builder**.

---

## Key Features

- **Full VR Walkthrough**
  - Smooth locomotion using XR Interaction Toolkit
  - Collision-based navigation (no walking through walls)

- **Physics-Based Object Interaction**
  - Grab, move, and release furniture
  - Realistic gravity and collision behavior

- **User-Controlled Dynamic Lighting**
  - Flashlight attached to VR controller
  - Toggle lighting using controller input (via VR Builder no-code logic)

- **Cross-Platform VR Compatibility**
  - Built on OpenXR for headset-agnostic support


## System Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

1. **Hardware Layer** – PC / VR Headset  
2. **Unity Engine Layer** – Rendering (URP), physics  
3. **XR Interaction Toolkit** – Locomotion & interaction  
4. **VR Builder Layer** – No-code interaction logic  
5. **Application Layer** – 3D assets & scene configuration

## Steps to run the project on Unity

This project is developed using **Unity 6** with **OpenXR-based VR support**.  
It can be run **with or without a physical VR headset**.

---

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
- **Unity Hub**
- **Unity Editor 6 (6000.1.14f1)** *(recommended)*
- **Windows OS** *(recommended)*

### Unity Packages
- Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- XR Interaction Toolkit
- OpenXR Plugin
- VR Builder
- XR Device Simulator

> All required packages are already configured in the project.

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nomaalam/Real-Estate-VR-Application-using-Unity.git
```
Or download the ZIP and extract it.

### Step 2: Open the Project in Unity

1.  Open **Unity Hub**.
2.  Click **Open** → **Add Project from Disk**.
3.  Select the root folder of this repository.
4.  Open the project using **Unity 6**.

> **Note:** First load may take a few minutes while packages are imported.

### Step 3: Verify Project Settings

**XR Setup**
* Go to: `Edit → Project Settings → XR Plug-in Management`
* Ensure **OpenXR** is enabled.
* Ensure Target platform is **PC, Mac & Linux Standalone**.

**Input System**
* Go to: `Edit → Project Settings → Player → Active Input Handling`
* Set to: **Input System Package (New)** OR **Both**.

### Step 4: Run Without a VR Headset (Simulator Mode)

If you do not have a VR headset, you can still run and test the project using the **XR Device Simulator**.

1.  Open the main scene.
2.  Press **Play ▶️** in Unity.


If you have a compatible headset (Meta Quest, HTC Vive, etc.):

1.  Connect headset to PC via Link Cable or AirLink.
2.  Ensure **Meta Link** or **SteamVR** is running.
3.  Ensure your headset supports **OpenXR**.
4.  Press **Play ▶️** in Unity.
